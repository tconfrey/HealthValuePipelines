A **Health Value Pipeline** is a concept as much as anything else. These posts capture some general notes and observations as I flesh out the concept. I'd like to capture a number of examples of value pipelines in action at different companies across the healthcare ecosystem. I'm also very interested in what the workflows are at play and which components and activities within those are common across multiple use cases.
